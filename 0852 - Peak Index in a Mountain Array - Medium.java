"""
You are given an integer mountain array arr of length n where the values increase to a peak element and then decrease.
Return the index of the peak element.
Your task is to solve it in O(log(n)) time complexity.

Example 1:
Input: arr = [0,1,0]
Output: 1

Example 2:
Input: arr = [0,2,1,0]
Output: 1

Example 3:
Input: arr = [0,10,5,2]
Output: 1

Constraints:
3 <= arr.length <= 105
0 <= arr[i] <= 106
arr is guaranteed to be a mountain array.
